Context


In the telecom industry,customers have the flexibility to choose from multiple service providers and frequently switch between operators. This competitive landscape results in an annual churn rate of approximately 15-25%. Since acquiring a new customer costs 5-10 times more than retaining an existing one, customer retention has become a higher priority than acquisition.

For many established telecom operators, retaining high-value customers is their top business objective. To mitigate churn, telecom companies must identify customers at high risk of leaving.

Project Overview


This project involves analyzing customer-level data from a leading telecom firm to develop predictive models that can detect customers at high risk of churn. Additionally, the project aims to identify key factors contributing to churn.




Objectives


Analyze customer-level data provided by upGrad.
Build an interpretable model to identify key churn indicators.
Develop three high-performance models to predict customer churn.
Recommend the most effective model for predicting churn.
